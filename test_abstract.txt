Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential diagnostic tool in clinical practice, offering superior soft tissue contrast compared to computed tomography (CT) and avoiding ionizing radiation exposure. However, traditional MRI acquisition techniques suffer from long scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing the likelihood of motion artifacts. Recent advances in compressed sensing and machine learning have enabled significant acceleration of MRI data acquisition while maintaining image quality. We developed a novel deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with iterative reconstruction techniques to achieve up to 8-fold acceleration in MRI scanning. Additionally, our approach utilizes a U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms to learn sparse representations of MRI data in both image and k-space domains. The proposed method achieved a PSNR of 42.3 ± 2.1 dB, SSIM of 0.94 ± 0.03, and NMSE of 0.015 ± 0.008 for 8-fold acceleration, significantly outperforming existing methods (p < 0.001). Consequently, clinical deployment of our algorithm has reduced average scan times from 45 minutes to 6 minutes for standard brain MRI protocols, while maintaining diagnostic quality equivalent to fully-sampled acquisitions.
