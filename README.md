# Abstract Format 📄✨

**Transform dense, unreadable scientific abstracts into beautifully formatted, digestible text.**

Abstract Format is an open-source Python library that uses advanced NLP techniques to automatically break up those nightmare 30-sentence paragraph blobs that plague scientific literature. No more squinting at walls of text!

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🧠 Smart Paragraph Breaking**: Uses spaCy NLP to detect discourse markers ("However,", "Additionally,", "Consequently,") for intelligent topic segmentation
- **📊 Technical Term Highlighting**: Automatically emphasizes abbreviations, statistics, and measurements
- **🎯 Multiple Strategies**: Combines discourse analysis, named entity recognition, and content pattern matching
- **📝 Multiple Output Formats**: Markdown, HTML, or plain text
- **⚡ CLI & Python API**: Use from command line or integrate into your workflow
- **🔧 Extensible Framework**: Easy to add processors for different document types

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Before (typical scientific abstract):**
> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential diagnostic tool in clinical practice offering superior soft tissue contrast compared to computed tomography (CT) and avoiding ionizing radiation exposure however traditional MRI acquisition techniques suffer from long scan times limiting patient throughput and increasing the likelihood of motion artifacts recent advances in compressed sensing and machine learning have enabled significant acceleration of MRI data acquisition while maintaining image quality we developed a novel deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm...

**After (with Abstract Format):**
> Magnetic resonance imaging (**MRI**) has become an essential diagnostic tool in
> clinical practice, offering superior soft tissue contrast compared to computed
> tomography (**CT**) and avoiding ionizing radiation exposure.
>
> However, traditional **MRI** acquisition techniques suffer from long scan times,
> limiting patient throughput and increasing the likelihood of motion artifacts.
>
> Recent advances in compressed sensing and machine learning have enabled
> significant acceleration of **MRI** data acquisition while maintaining image quality.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub release (recommended)
```bash
# Install latest release
pip install git+https://github.com/ethandrower/abstract_pretty_format.git@v0.1.0

# Or install from main branch
pip install git+https://github.com/ethandrower/abstract_pretty_format.git
```

### Option 2: From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethandrower/abstract_pretty_format.git
cd abstract_pretty_format
pip install -e .
```

### spaCy Model (required for advanced features)
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Command Line
```bash
# Format from file
abstract-format paper_abstract.txt

# Format from clipboard (macOS)
pbpaste | abstract-format

# Save to file
abstract-format input.txt -o formatted.md

# HTML output
abstract-format --format html input.txt

# Analyze structure
abstract-format --analyze input.txt
```

### Python API
```python
from abstract_format import SpacyAbstractFormatter

# Initialize formatter
formatter = SpacyAbstractFormatter()

# Your dense abstract
abstract = """
BACKGROUND: FLASH radiotherapy is an emerging treatment modality using ultra-high dose rate beams. Much effort has been made to develop suitable dosimeters for reference dosimetry, yet the spatial beam characteristics must also be characterized to enable computerized treatment planning...
"""

# Format it!
formatted = formatter.format_abstract(abstract)
print(formatted)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Discourse Marker Detection
The formatter recognizes linguistic transition signals:
- **Contrast**: "However,", "Nevertheless,", "Conversely,"
- **Addition**: "Additionally,", "Furthermore,", "Moreover," 
- **Result**: "Consequently,", "Therefore,", "Thus,"
- **Sequence**: "First,", "Next,", "Finally,"

### 2. Advanced NLP Analysis
Using spaCy's trained models:
- **Sentence Segmentation**: Proper handling of abbreviations and decimals
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Tracks organizations, products, and locations
- **Entity Shift Detection**: New paragraph when topic changes significantly

### 3. Content Pattern Recognition
- Detects results sections with statistics and measurements
- Identifies methodology vs. findings transitions
- Recognizes conclusion markers

### 4. Multi-Strategy Decision Making
Combines all signals with intelligent fallbacks and paragraph merging.

## 📊 Examples

### Structured Abstract (with explicit headers)
**Input:**
```
BACKGROUND: Text here... PURPOSE: Text here... METHODS: Text here...
```

**Output:**
```markdown
### BACKGROUND
Text here...

### PURPOSE  
Text here...

### METHODS
Text here...
```

### Unstructured Abstract (discourse marker detection)
**Input:**
```
We tested several approaches. However, the results were inconclusive. Additionally, we found technical limitations. Consequently, we recommend further research.
```

**Output:**
```markdown
We tested several approaches.

However, the results were inconclusive.

Additionally, we found technical limitations. 

Consequently, we recommend further research.
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Line Width
```python
from abstract_format import SpacyAbstractFormatter

formatter = SpacyAbstractFormatter(line_width=100)
result = formatter.format_abstract(text)
```

### Extensible Framework
```python
from abstract_format import ScientificDocumentFormatter, DocumentProcessor

# Create custom processor
class MyCustomProcessor(DocumentProcessor):
    def can_process(self, document):
        return "custom_field" in document
    
    def process(self, document, **kwargs):
        return f"Processed: {document['custom_field']}"

# Add to formatter
formatter = ScientificDocumentFormatter()
formatter.add_processor(MyCustomProcessor())
```

### Analysis Mode
```python
from abstract_format import AbstractAnalyzer

analyzer = AbstractAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_structure(text)

print(f"Word count: {analysis['word_count']}")
print(f"Sentences: {analysis['sentence_count']}")
print(f"Technical terms: {analysis['technical_terms']}")
print(f"Has sections: {analysis['has_structured_sections']}")
```
